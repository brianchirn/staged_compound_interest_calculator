Compound Interest Calculator that adjusts returns based on stages

Frustrated with most online compound interest calculators that make static assumptions ( one interest rate, one yearly contribution). In reality a calculator should take into account stages of an investors life. For example, if a student may contribute less in the first 4 years but make more aggresive investments, while later in their career make larger contributions but safer returns.

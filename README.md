Compound Interest Calculator that adjusts returns based on stages

Frustrated with most online compound interest calculators that make static assumptions ( one interest rate, one yearly contribution). In reality a calculator should take into account stages of an investors life. For example, if a student may contribute less in the first 4 years but make more aggresive investments, while later in their career make larger contributions but safer returns. 

Example:
A college student with 10,000 initial investment and 2 career stages (during college and post college). They can contribute 6,000 during school for 5 years. After college they will contribute 12,000 for 20 years. During their college years they invest in risky stocks that generate higher percent returns. 

Enter number of career stages: 2
Enter interest rate for stage 1: 12
Enter interest rate for stage 2: 8
Enter num years for stage 1: 5
Enter num years for stage 2: 20
Enter yearly addition for stage 1: 6000
Enter yearly addition for stage 2: 12000
Enter starting principal: 10000
Final Principal:
